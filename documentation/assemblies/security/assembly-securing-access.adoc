= Securing access to Kafka

[role="_abstract"]
Secure your Kafka cluster by managing the access a client has to Kafka brokers.
Specify configuration options to secure Kafka brokers and clients

A secure connection between Kafka brokers and clients can encompass the following:

* Encryption for data exchange
* Authentication to prove identity
* Authorization to allow or decline actions executed by users

The authentication and authorization mechanisms specified for a client must match those specified for the Kafka brokers.
Strimzi operators automate the configuration process and create the certificates required for authentication.
The Cluster Operator automatically sets up TLS certificates for data encryption and authentication within your cluster.
