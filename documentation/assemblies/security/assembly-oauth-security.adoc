= Enabling OAuth 2.0 token-based access

[role="_abstract"]
Strimzi supports OAuth 2.0 for securing Kafka clusters by integrating with an OAUth 2.0 authorization server. 
Kafka brokers and clients both need to be configured to use OAuth 2.0.

OAuth 2.0 enables standardized token-based authentication and authorization between applications, using a central authorization server to issue tokens that grant limited access to resources.
You can define specific scopes for fine-grained access control.
Scopes correspond to different levels of access to Kafka topics or operations within the cluster.  
OAuth 2.0 also supports single sign-on and integration with identity providers.
